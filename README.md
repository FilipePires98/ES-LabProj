# Where the ISS at
A simple real-time graphical visualization of positional data of the International Space Station

## Description

This project aims to demonstrate the use of REST APIs and Event Streams to provide real-time online services.
The proposed web project is a simple live tracking system of the International Space Station (ISS).

The data is taken from a [free API](https://wheretheiss.at/).
We retrieve the data, store it in a H2 database, with the help of JPA, and present the information in a simple web-UI containing a world map.
All requests made by our clients are logged through Kafka.
The deployment is done using docker containers and all code is presented with the proper documentation.

## Instructions on how to run the code

1. Have installed Docker and Docker Compose.
2. On repository's root folder, build the docker containers and start them:
```shell
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```
3. Open a browser, enter the address 'http://localhost:8080/' and enjoy the application.
7. [Optional] Check out the address 'http://localhost:5000/' to see the Kafka logs and events live in a simple web UI.
